      <li>It's important know the difference between mapping with a vector or map/set. The main difference between these is the space, with a vector the space
      you need is equal a number (if you initilize the vector), but with a map/set the space you need is only the values you have so isn't mandatory initilize a lenght
      of this structure becuase you can do insert elements and check is that element existe or not.</li><br>
      <li>The difference between unordered_set and unordered_set is: with a unordered_map you can use a key and value, so is possible get a value with its key. 
      In other hand, with a unordered_set isn't possible has a key, we only insert elements like v.push_back().</li>
